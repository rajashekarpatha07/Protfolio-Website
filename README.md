# Portfolio 🌐

Welcome to my personal **Portfolio** repository! This project showcases my skills and learning journey in web development.

## About This Project 🎓

I created this portfolio after going through the **Code with Harry Sigma WebDev** course. It represents my progress in web development, focusing on:
- **HTML**: Structuring the layout and content of the portfolio.
- **CSS**: Styling the layout to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and functionality to the portfolio.

## My Journey 🚀

While I am still learning **Backend Development**, this portfolio is a **frontend-only** project, with no backend integrated. The website currently doesn't have a backend as I have just started learning **Node.js** and backend development. This project reflects my work in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Why This Repo? 🤔

This repository serves as a showcase of my **front-end skills** and my ability to create visually engaging web pages. It’s a work-in-progress, and I’m constantly improving and refining it as I learn more about web development.

## Features ✨

- A clean, responsive layout built with **HTML** and **CSS**.
- **JavaScript** to enhance the interactivity of the page.
- A modern design inspired by the latest web development trends.

Feel free to explore the code and see how I’ve put everything together!
